Context & Objective

The CLEANSKY project aims to leverage Earth Observation data (satellite imagery, environmental sensors, etc.) to predict cleaner and safer atmospheric conditions, such as air quality, air pollution, or other environmental indicators.
The idea is to transform raw data (“EarthData”) into useful insights or forecasts—for example, to guide policy decisions, alerts, or interventions.
The project likely relies on cloud computing, data processing pipelines, and predictive models based on machine learning or deep learning techniques.
